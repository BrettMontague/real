Reproduction number Estimation Accounting for Lead time

A minimally parameterized algorithm for estimating on average how many cases stem from an existing case in a viral pandemic, for each date during the pandemic. Rather than fitting an exponential curve to the entire dataset, a weighted average of later-dated cases is used to derive a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number#Effective_reproduction_number](reproduction number). This weighting is empiricially estimated from the virus biology.
